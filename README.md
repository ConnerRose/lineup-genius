# Lineup Genius

> Generate optimal high school swim meet linups.

Uses greedy algorithm to attempt to maximize [power points](https://www.usaswimming.org/times/popular-resources/power-point-calculator) for a team in a dual meet or championship meet setting. Downloads times from [Swim Cloud](https://www.swimcloud.com), stores them as .csv file for quicker loading times, and manipulates the data all using `pandas`.

Currently in development but feel free to poke around.
